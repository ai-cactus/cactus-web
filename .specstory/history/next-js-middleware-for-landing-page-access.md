## Next.js Middleware for Landing Page Access (1/19/2025, 4:36:50 PM)

_**User**_

create a middleware that prevents the user from going to any other page aside the first root page. This is a @NextJS project. We are still working on it so for now only the landing page should be visible

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a middleware that restricts access to only the root page (`/`) and redirects all other routes back to the root page.

Here's how to implement this:

```typescript:middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Get the pathname of the request
  const path = request.nextUrl.pathname

  // Allow access to the root path '/' and any static assets
  if (
    path === '/' || 
    path.startsWith('/_next') || 
    path.startsWith('/api') ||
    path.includes('.')  // This covers static files like images, css, etc.
  ) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  // Redirect all other routes to the homepage
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url))
}

// Configure the paths that middleware will run on
export const config = {
  matcher: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
}
```

This middleware will:

1. Allow access to:
   - The root path (`/`)
   - Next.js system paths (`/_next/*`)
   - API routes (`/api/*`)
   - Static files (images, CSS, etc.)

2. Redirect all other paths back to the homepage (`/`)

The `matcher` configuration ensures that the middleware doesn't run on static files and API routes, which improves performance.

Place this file in your project root (at the same level as your `app` or `pages` directory). If you're using a `src` directory, place it inside `src` at the root level.

This will effectively lock down your site to only show the landing page while you're working on the rest of the application.

_**User**_

I want to deploy this project to cloudflare pages. How do I set it up?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up your Next.js project for deployment on Cloudflare Pages. Here are the steps:

1. First, we need to modify your Next.js configuration to make it compatible with Cloudflare Pages. Create or update your `next.config.js`:

```javascript:next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
  // Enable Cloudflare specific features
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Required for Cloudflare Pages
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

2. Create a `.gitignore` file if you don't have one already:

```text:.gitignore
# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts
```

3. Then follow these deployment steps:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard (https://dash.cloudflare.com)
3. Navigate to "Pages"
4. Click "Create a project"
5. Select "Connect to Git"
6. Select your GitHub repository
7. Configure your build settings:

```plaintext
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: .next
Root directory: /
```

8. Add these Environment Variables in the Cloudflare Pages settings:

```plaintext
NODE_VERSION: 18
```

4. Create or update your `package.json` to include these scripts:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

After setting this up:

1. Commit all your changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Cloudflare Pages will automatically detect the changes and start the deployment

Important Notes:

1. Make sure your project is using Next.js 13+ for best compatibility with Cloudflare Pages
2. If you're using any API routes or Server Components, you'll need to use Cloudflare Pages with Functions enabled
3. Some Next.js features might need additional configuration to work with Cloudflare Pages:
   - Image Optimization needs to be disabled (which we did in the config)
   - Middleware (which you're using) should work fine
   - Dynamic API routes work with Cloudflare Functions

To check your deployment status, you can go to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard and monitor the build process. Once deployed, Cloudflare will provide you with a `.pages.dev` domain where your site will be accessible.

If you need to add a custom domain later:
1. Go to your Pages project
2. Click on "Custom domains"
3. Add your domain and follow the DNS configuration instructions

Remember to check the Cloudflare Pages logs if you encounter any deployment issues, as they provide detailed information about any build or runtime errors.

_**User**_

following this documentation, setup this codebase to be deployed to cloudflare pages. The documentation: @https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/ssr/get-started/ 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up your Next.js project for Cloudflare Pages with SSR support. Based on the documentation, we need to make several changes:

1. First, let's install the required dependency:

```typescript:package.json
{
  // ... existing code ...
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... existing devDependencies ...
    "@cloudflare/next-on-pages": "latest",
    "wrangler": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "pages:build": "npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages",
    "preview": "npm run pages:build && wrangler pages dev",
    "deploy": "npm run pages:build && wrangler pages deploy"
  }
}
```

2. Create a new Wrangler configuration file:

```toml:wrangler.toml
name = "ai-cactus"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-29"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
pages_build_output_dir = ".vercel/output/static"
```

3. Update your Next.js configuration:

```javascript:next.config.js
import { setupDevPlatform } from '@cloudflare/next-on-pages/next-dev';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Remove the standalone output since we're using Pages Functions
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Required for Cloudflare Pages
  }
};

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  await setupDevPlatform();
}

export default nextConfig;
```

4. Optional but recommended - Add ESLint plugin for Cloudflare Pages:

```json:.eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "plugin:eslint-plugin-next-on-pages/recommended"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "eslint-plugin-next-on-pages"
  ]
}
```

5. Since you're using middleware, make sure it uses the Edge Runtime by adding this line to your middleware.ts:

```typescript:middleware.ts
export const runtime = "edge";

// ... rest of your existing middleware code ...
```

To deploy:

1. First, install the new dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @cloudflare/next-on-pages wrangler eslint-plugin-next-on-pages
```

2. Then you can either:

A. Deploy via CLI:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

OR

B. Deploy via Git:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages
3. Create new project → Connect to Git
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Framework preset: Next.js
   - Build command: npm run pages:build
   - Build output directory: .vercel/output/static
   - Environment variables:
     - NODE_VERSION: 18

Important Notes:
1. Make sure all your server-side components and API routes use the Edge Runtime
2. Your project will need to be compatible with the Edge Runtime since Cloudflare Pages doesn't support the Node.js runtime in the same way as traditional hosting
3. Some Node.js-specific APIs might not be available, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly
4. The `mongodb` connection might need to be adjusted to work with Cloudflare Pages - you might want to use Cloudflare's D1 or KV for database operations instead

_**User**_

Alright we have this error when running the deployment in cloudflare: You are using Node.js 18.17.1. For Next.js, Node.js version "^18.18.0 || ^19.8.0 || >= 20.0.0" is required.

What do we do about it?

---

_**Assistant**_

We need to update the Node.js version to meet Next.js requirements. Let's make two changes:

1. First, let's add an `.nvmrc` file to specify the Node.js version:

```text:.nvmrc
20.11.1
```

2. Then, let's update the Node version in your package.json by adding an engines field:

```json:package.json
{
  // ... existing code ...
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0"
  },
  // ... rest of your package.json
}
```

For Cloudflare Pages deployment, you'll need to:

1. Go to your project settings in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Find "Environment Variables"
3. Add/Update the `NODE_VERSION` variable to:
```
NODE_VERSION: 20.11.1
```

After making these changes:
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Run `npm install` locally with the new Node version
3. Try deploying again with `npm run deploy`

If you're developing locally, you should also update your Node.js version to 20.x. If you're using nvm, you can run:
```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

This should resolve the Node.js version compatibility error during deployment.

Getting this error while running in cloudflare: FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key).

Looks like the pages build is not getting my environment variables. There is this warning above too: Build environment variables: (none found)


---

_**Assistant**_



We need to properly set up environment variables for Cloudflare Pages. There are two places where we need to add them:

1. First, let's make sure your local `.env` file has all the required Firebase variables:

```text:.env.example
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

2. Then, you need to add these environment variables to Cloudflare Pages:

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > Environment variables
4. Add each of the environment variables from your `.env` file
5. Make sure to add them to both "Production" and "Preview" environments
6. For variables that need to be available on the client-side (like Firebase config), make sure they start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

Here's how to add them via Wrangler CLI if you prefer:

```bash
# For production
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY "your_api_key"
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN "your_auth_domain"
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID "your_project_id"
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET "your_storage_bucket"
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID "your_messaging_sender_id"
wrangler pages deployment env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID "your_app_id"

# For preview environments
wrangler pages project env set NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY "your_api_key"
# ... repeat for other variables
```

Also, let's update the `.gitignore` to make sure we don't accidentally commit the example file:

```text:.gitignore
# ... existing entries ...

# env files
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

After adding these environment variables:
1. Go back to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Trigger a new deployment (you can do this by clicking "Retry deployment" on your last failed build)

This should resolve the Firebase API key error as the environment variables will now be available during build time and runtime.

---

_**User**_

I added the env vars to the cloudflare dashboard but I am still getting the issue. Is there something wrong with my wrangler file? This is in the logs: 
Found wrangler.toml file. Reading build configuration...
11:15:43.302	pages_build_output_dir: .vercel/output/static
11:15:43.302	Build environment variables: (none found)

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, we need to modify the `wrangler.toml` file to properly handle environment variables. Let's update it:

```toml:wrangler.toml
name = "ai-cactus"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-29"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[build]
command = "npm run build"
output_dir = ".vercel/output/static"

[build.environment]
NODE_VERSION = "20.11.1"

[env.production]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "production" }

[site]
bucket = ".vercel/output/static"
```

Also, let's make sure your Next.js config is properly set up to handle environment variables. Create or update your `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript:next.config.mjs
import { setupDevPlatform } from '@cloudflare/next-on-pages/next-dev';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
  }
};

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  await setupDevPlatform();
}

export default nextConfig;
```

Additionally, let's verify that your Firebase initialization is properly handling the environment variables. Could you show me your `lib/firebase.ts` file? We might need to add some error handling there to make sure it fails gracefully if environment variables are missing.

After making these changes:
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
3. Go to Settings > Environment variables
4. Verify all your environment variables are there and properly set
5. Trigger a new deployment

Also, make sure that in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, under the "Build & Deploy" settings:
1. The build command is set to: `npm run pages:build`
2. The build output directory is set to: `.vercel/output/static`
3. The environment variables are set for both "Production" and "Preview" environments

build works well but we have this error: 
✘ [ERROR] Error: Pages only supports files up to 25 MiB in size
11:41:53.381	
11:41:53.381	  cache/webpack/server-production/0.pack is 57.9 MiB in size

how do we reduce the bundle size?

---

_**Assistant**_



To reduce the bundle size, we'll need to make several optimizations. Here's what we can do:

1. First, update your `next.config.mjs` to enable webpack bundle analyzer so we can see what's taking up space:

```javascript:next.config.mjs
import { setupDevPlatform } from '@cloudflare/next-on-pages/next-dev';
import { withAxiom } from 'next-axiom';
import bundleAnalyzer from '@next/bundle-analyzer';

const withBundleAnalyzer = bundleAnalyzer({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
  },
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    // Optimize CKEditor bundle
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\]icons[/\\][^/\\]+\.svg$/,
      use: ['raw-loader'],
    });

    // Exclude large development-only packages from the server bundle
    if (isServer) {
      config.externals = [...(config.externals || []), {
        'react-dom': 'react-dom',
        '@tanstack/react-query-devtools': '@tanstack/react-query-devtools',
      }];
    }

    return config;
  },
  // Add modularizeImports to reduce bundle size
  modularizeImports: {
    'react-icons': {
      transform: 'react-icons/{{member}}',
    },
  },
};

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  await setupDevPlatform();
}

// Apply bundle analyzer wrapper
export default withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig);
```

2. Install the bundle analyzer:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer
```

3. Create a new script in your `package.json`:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ... existing scripts ...
    "analyze": "ANALYZE=true npm run build"
  }
}
```

4. Let's also optimize your CKEditor imports. Create a new file for CKEditor configuration:

```typescript:lib/editor-config.ts
// Import only the features you actually use
import { CKEditor } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react';
import { essentials } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials';
// Add only the features you need

export const editorConfig = {
  plugins: [
    essentials,
    // Add only the plugins you actually use
  ],
  toolbar: {
    items: [
      // Add only the toolbar items you actually use
    ]
  }
};
```

5. Update your imports in components to use dynamic imports where possible:

```typescript:components/editor/index.tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Dynamically import CKEditor
const CKEditor = dynamic(
  () => import('@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react').then((mod) => mod.CKEditor),
  { ssr: false }
);

// Rest of your editor component...
```

6. For Firebase, make sure you're only importing what you need:

```typescript:lib/firebase.ts
import { initializeApp, getApps } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
// Only import the specific Firebase services you use

const firebaseConfig = {
  // your config
};

// Initialize Firebase only if it hasn't been initialized
const app = !getApps().length ? initializeApp(firebaseConfig) : getApps()[0];
const auth = getAuth(app);

export { app, auth };
```

7. Add a `.npmrc` file to enable selective installs:

```text:.npmrc
auto-install-peers=false
strict-peer-dependencies=false
```

After making these changes:
1. Run `npm run analyze` to see what's taking up space
2. Remove any unused dependencies
3. Try the build again with `npm run pages:build`

If you're still having issues, we might need to:
1. Split your app into smaller chunks
2. Remove some features that are causing the bundle to be too large
3. Consider using lighter alternatives for some of your dependencies

Let me know if you still have issues after implementing these changes, and we can look at the bundle analyzer output to make more specific optimizations.

_**User**_

cache/webpack/client-production/0.pack is 77.5 MiB in size
12:22:07.424	how do we solve this? by deleting the cache after build?

---

_**Assistant**_

The issue isn't with the cache itself - we need to further optimize the bundle size. Let's update the Next.js config to better handle code splitting and optimization:

```javascript:next.config.mjs
import { setupDevPlatform } from '@cloudflare/next-on-pages/next-dev';
import bundleAnalyzer from '@next/bundle-analyzer';

const withBundleAnalyzer = bundleAnalyzer({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
  },
  output: 'export',
  distDir: 'out',
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    // Exclude large development-only packages from the bundle
    if (!isServer) {
      config.resolve.alias = {
        ...config.resolve.alias,
        '@tanstack/react-query-devtools': false,
      };
    }

    // Optimize chunks
    config.optimization = {
      ...config.optimization,
      splitChunks: {
        chunks: 'all',
        minSize: 20000,
        maxSize: 24000000,
        minChunks: 1,
        maxAsyncRequests: 30,
        maxInitialRequests: 30,
        cacheGroups: {
          default: false,
          vendors: false,
          framework: {
            chunks: 'all',
            name: 'framework',
            test: /(?<!node_modules.*)[\\/]node_modules[\\/](react|react-dom|scheduler|prop-types|use-subscription)[\\/]/,
            priority: 40,
            enforce: true,
          },
          lib: {
            test(module) {
              return module.size() > 160000 &&
                /node_modules[/\\]/.test(module.identifier());
            },
